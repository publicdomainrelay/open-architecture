 * allows the prioritizer to make decisions based on the spirit of the law --
 * intent-based policy rather than rote rule matching.
 *
 * The trinity builds a pyramid of thought alignment to strategic principles:
 * top-level organizational policies cascade down through the operations of
 * each data flow, and the provenance of every inference can be traced back to
 * which corner of the trinity produced it. One of those strategic principles
 * is: "We must be able to trust the sources of all input data used for all
 * model training was done from research studies with these ethical
 * certifications."
 *
 * The trinity is the process of triangulation: by measuring and forming
 * understanding across the three corners we are able to locate the strategic
 * plans and principles involved in the execution of software as well as its
 * development lifecycle. The trinity represents the soul of the software.
 * Intent is measured by conformance to and completeness of the threat model
 * and therefore also the associated Open Architecture description.
 *
 * Alice is at the center of the Trinity: `alice please contribute` lives in
 * the Static Analysis corner (understanding what the code says), the Open
 * Architecture and SCITT live in the Intent corner (what we aim to do), and
 * the dynamic analysis corner (how the code behaves when executed) is where
 * we observe the runtime mapping back to intent.

 * coordination. This avoids lock contention and simplifies the subflow's

 * automates: (1) creating a child orchestrator context from the parent's
 * current operation implementation context, (2) copying inputs from the
 * parent into the child while preserving their origins, and (3) running the
 * child dataflow and returning its outputs typed to the expected definition.
 *
 * Lock annotations on definitions (`LockReadWrite[T]`) signal to the

 * rather than consumed directly.
 *
 * For example, an ELF binary does not reuse its parent's input network context
 * (it lacks access to the parent's memory region), while Python code running
 * in the same process does reuse the parent's input network context (it has
